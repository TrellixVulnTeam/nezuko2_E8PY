Demon Night 1.2
© 1996 Brain Eaters Font Company.
Shareware: $5.00

This font is from Brain Eaters Font Co.   Fonts based on B-Movies- Horror,
Sci-Fi, & Exploitation. After doing a B-Movie Magazine for a few years I
became tired of looking for specific genre styles, so I decided to do my
own. Based on the jaggy looking letterforms of "The Tales from the Crypt"
Movie- "Demon Knight" poster.  A tall serif face with scary shapes.
